About this project:

Just a simple project I created using Knockout.js.
It has no special CSS or other visual spectacle but has an example of every thing you can use in the library (the majority of it)

Guide:

- add knockout.js library under the file name "knockout.js"
- add jQuery library under the file name "jQuery.js"
